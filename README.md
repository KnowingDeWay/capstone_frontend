Front End Setup:

1.	Open Visual Studio Code (this is a lightweight version of Visual Studio better suited for front-end development)
2.	Go into the repo folder and select the project folder within it named “extensible-dynamics” 
3.	The terminal is a hard requirement and an absolute must for developing and working with sophisticated front-end web applications. To open a terminal, go to the Terminal tab in the toolbar then click “New Terminal”
4.	Before the application can be ran, the associated node modules for the application must be downloaded and installed. These modules are stored in the “node modules” folder and this folder and all the contents within are not and should not be stored in GitHub or version control and should be ignored by Git. To download and install the required node modules, type “npm install --save” then press Enter.

Node modules are special dependencies that an application relies upon that originate from many external sources that are all accessible via npm (Node Package Manager) which is a software platform, company and web tool that manages and centralises all node packages from all sources. Node packages are advantageous as they give special and additional functionality with minimal development.

5.	In the terminal below, type “ng serve” and then wait until the terminal states that it has compiled the code successfully and has also started the server successfully with the URL of the server
 
6.	Press Ctrl+Click on the URL to view the homepage of the front-end web application. A browser window should show with the login page.
 
If you wish, you may login to the system and view the rest of the web application for yourself if you wish.

7.	To do any development on the web application, it is strongly recommended or somewhat required for you to download and install some extensions for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) which are additional software components developed by various individuals in the VS Code community that provide additional functionality. You can access the Extensions menu by pressing the button with the 4 square blocks in the left toolbar.
	
Some recommended/required extensions include:
•	Angular Extension Pack
•	TSLint
•	GitHub (this is a must)
•	GitHub Pull Requests and Issues (this is a must)
